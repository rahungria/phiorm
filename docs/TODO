fk deserialization
auto fields (generated by database)
finish (de)serialization
postgres filter
on delete events
postgres delete
postgres save
foreign key cascade
float field, datetime field
many to many abstraction... HARD
refactor _cache to proper object with more functionality
add queryset like class for more transparency
multiple primary keys!!!
